# What this Repository contains:
This git repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that we as 3rd year GMIT Computing students were tasked with doing in our Graph Theory Module.
The note book contains the following.

## HeapSort.ipnyb Notbook
This is one of the 2 notebooks in this repository. It contains the following

  * Explanation of the Heap Sort algorithm

  *  Explanation of the computational complexity of Heap Sort.
  *  Explanation of how graph theory is used in Heap Sort.

## Graph Isomorphism.ipnyb Notbook
This is the 2nd notebook in the repository, it contains

  *  Explanation of the Graph Iomorphism Problem.
  *  Explanation of how graphs can be represented in data structures.
  *  Python function implementing an algorithm to determine if two graphs are isomorphic or not.
  *  Discussion of the computational complexity of the Graph Isomorphism Problem.
