    "Heapsort is a comparing technique based on the binary heap data structure. It sorts the data by making two heaps. It does this by extracting the largest or smallest child of data from the left and sorts it to right heap. A binary heap is a tree of data in which every parent is either greater in size or smaller than the 2 child nodes. This is called a max or min heap. The properties of a max or min heap are as follows.<br>\n",
